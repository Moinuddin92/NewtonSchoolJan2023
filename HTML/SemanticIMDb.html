        <p>In an interview with The Times of India, Prashanth Neel stated that he planned to split the film in two
            parts, as the narration of the story is in a non-linear format. The decision to split the film into two
            parts also had to do with its commercial prospects. He further added “The scale of the project is huge and
            we had a scope for a beginning, an interval, and an end for both parts, so it made sense for us to release
            it as two parts”. </p>
